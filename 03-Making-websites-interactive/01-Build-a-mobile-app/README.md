# Mobile Shopping List App with Firebase

## Project Overview

Transform a web-based leads tracker into a mobile-ready shopping list app that stores data in Firebase's real-time database. This project teaches fundamental database integration and mobile-first web development.

## Core Requirements

### Firebase Integration
- Connect to Firebase real-time database using database URL
- Replace localStorage with Firebase database operations
- Implement real-time data synchronization
- Push and retrieve shopping list items from Firebase

### Data Operations
- **Add Items**: Save new shopping list items to Firebase
- **Display Items**: Render all items from the Firebase database
- **Delete Items**: Remove items from Firebase (optional - depends on original app functionality)
- **Real-time Updates**: Items sync across sessions using Firebase's JSON-based database

### Mobile Web App
- Convert the leads tracker interface to a shopping list theme
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Add to home screen capability (installable web app)
- App should look and feel like a native mobile application when installed

### Technical Setup
1. Create Firebase project and get database URL
2. Connect JavaScript code to Firebase using the provided URL
3. Replace all localStorage calls with Firebase database methods
4. Test data persistence across browser sessions

## Key Differences from Original Leads Tracker (localStorage) Project

- Database: Firebase real-time database instead of localStorage
- Theme: Shopping list instead of leads tracker
- Platform: Mobile-optimized web app instead of Chrome extension
- Data persistence: Cloud-based instead of local-only
